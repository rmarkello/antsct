# ANTS Longitudinal Cortical Thickness with visual QC and extra outputs

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Code for running ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness pipeline on BIDS data using the MNI152 ICBM nonlinear asymmetric 2009c template.

Similar to the [BIDS-App](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/antsCorticalThickness) but this also takes into account other potential data modalities for input to the pipeline and outputs some deformation-based morphometry / cortical thickness output files.
